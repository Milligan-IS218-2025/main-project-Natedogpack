        <h2>About to author</h2>
        <p>
            I grew up in Gulfport Mississippi in a family of 5. 
            Growing up I was never the athletic type of kid. 
            I was by all means a nerd. I was the kid who played
            the violin and took the ACT in the 8th grade to make a 24/36.
            All this to say I was in no way someone involved in cycling.
        </p>

            This all changed towards the end of middle school. I entered
            physical therapy in the beggining of middle school and when 
            I was leaving physical therapy at the end of middle school 
            they suggested taking up recreational cycling. This recreational 
            cycling led to my current love for the sport and even led me to 
            pursue the sport on the college level. I have recieved support 
            from a countless number of people throughout my journey 
            and wouldn't have made it without them.
        </p>

            In the same way people have been there to help me along my way. 
            I hope those reading this webpage can use the information found
            here to better their understanding of collegiate cycling.
