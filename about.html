        <p>
           &NonBreakingSpace; I grew up in Gulfport, Mississippi in a family of 5. <br>
           &NonBreakingSpace; Growing up, I was never the athletic type of kid. I was, <br>
           &NonBreakingSpace; by all means, a nerd. I was the kid who played the violin <br>
           &NonBreakingSpace; and took the ACT in the 8th grade to make a 24/36. All <br>
           &NonBreakingSpace; this to say I was in no way someone involved in cycling. <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            &NonBreakingSpace; This all changed towards the end of middle school. I entered <br>
            &NonBreakingSpace; physical therapy in the beggining of middle school and when <br>
            &NonBreakingSpace; I was leaving physical therapy at the end of middle school <br>
            &NonBreakingSpace; they suggested taking up recreational cycling. This recreational <br>
            &NonBreakingSpace; cycling led to my current love for the sport and even led me to <br>
            &NonBreakingSpace; pursue the sport on the college level. I have recieved support <br>
            &NonBreakingSpace; from a countless number of people throughout my journey <br>
            &NonBreakingSpace; and wouldn't have made it without them. <br>  
        </p>
        <p>
            &NonBreakingSpace; In the same way people have been there to help me along my way, <br>
            &NonBreakingSpace; I hope those reading this webpage can use the information found <br>
            &NonBreakingSpace; here to better their understanding of collegiate cycling. <br>
