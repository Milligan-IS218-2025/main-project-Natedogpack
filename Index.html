        <H1>About the SECCC and Milligan Cycling</H1>
        <p>The Milligan Cycling team including myself compete against other schools in the south eastern United States. Within the US there are 4 main collegiate cycling conferences with the SECCC otherwise known as the South East collegiate Cycling conferences being the one for our region. Within the SECCC there are 4 main disciplines; Track, Mountain biking, Cyclocross, and Road.</p>
        <p>This Website will Focus on the Road season and will be a publication of the race weekend results. I hope that my readers will gain a deeper understand of what collegiate cycling is and how it is growing.</p>
