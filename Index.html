        <H1>About the SECCC and Milligan Cycling</H1>
            <p>
            The Milligan Cycling team including myself compete <br>
            against other schools in the south eastern United <br>
            States. Within the US there are 4 main collegiate <br>
            cycling conferences with the SECCC otherwise <br>
            known as the South East collegiate Cycling <br>
            conferences being the one for our region. Within <br>
            the SECCC there are 4 main disciplines; Track, <br>
            Mountain biking, Cyclocross, and Road. This Website <br>
            will Focus on the Road season and will be a <br>
            publication of the race weekend results. I hope <br>
            that my readers will gain a deeper understand of <br>
            what collegiate cycling is and how it is growing. <br>
